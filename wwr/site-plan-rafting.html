    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>After several and extensive research in the White-Water Rafting business, we have decided to target two main audiences. One would be the enthusiasts and the other would be the adventurers.
        Here at King’s Palace Resort, we take rafting to a new level. It’s more than white water rafting it is having rafting water fights during the calm parts of the river or really pushing through rapids to get your adrenaline going. At the end of the day, you feel renewed and glad that you chose this “UNFORGETABLE EXPERIENCE”. NOW IS THE TIME!!! </p>
